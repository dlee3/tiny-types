TinyTypes is an [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiny-types) that makes it easy for TypeScript and JavaScript
projects to give domain meaning to primitive types. It also helps to avoid all sorts of bugs 
and makes your code easier to refactor.

## Installation

To install the module from npm:

```
npm install --save tiny-types
```

## Defining Tiny Types

> An int on its own is just a scalar with no meaning. With an object, even a small one, you are giving both the compiler 
and the programmer additional information  about what the value is and why it is being used.

### Single-value types

To define a single-value `TinyType` - extend from `TinyTypeOf<T>()`:

```typescript
import { TinyTypeOf } from 'tiny-types';

class FirstName extends TinyTypeOf<string>() {}
class LastName  extends TinyTypeOf<string>() {}
class Age       extends TinyTypeOf<number>() {}
```
 
Every tiny type defined this way has
a [readonly property](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html#readonly-modifier)
`value` of type `T`, which you can use to access the wrapped primitive value. For example:

```typescript
const firstName = new FirstName('Jan');

firstName.value === 'Jan';
```

It also has an `equals` method, which you can use to compare tiny types by value:

```typescript
const 
    name1 = new FirstName('Jan'),
    name2 = new FirstName('Jan');

name1.equals(name2) === true; 
```

An additional feature of tiny types is a built-in `toString()` method (which you can override if you want to, of course):

```typescript
const name = new FirstName('Jan');

name.toString() === 'FirstName(value=Jan)';
```

### Multi-value and complex types

If the tiny type you want to model has more than one value,
or you want to perform additional operations in the constructor,
extend from `TinyType` directly:

```typescript
import { TinyType } from 'tiny-types';

class Person extends TinyType {
    constructor(public readonly firstName: FirstName,
                public readonly lastName: LastName,
    ) {
        super();
    }
}

```

You can also mix and match both of the above definition styles:

```typescript
import { TinyType, TinyTypeOf } from 'tiny-types';

class UserName extends TinyTypeOf<string>() {}

class Timestamp extends TinyTypeOf<Date>() {}

abstract class DomainEvent extends TinyTypeOf<Timestamp>() {}

class AccountCreated extends DomainEvent {
    constructor(public readonly username: UserName, timestamp: Timestamp) {
        super(timestamp);
    }
}

const event = new AccountCreated(new UserName('jan-molak'), new Timestamp(new Date()));
```

Even such complex types still have both the `equals` and `toString` methods:

```typescript 
const 
    now = new Date(2018, 2, 12, 0, 30),
    event1 = new AccountCreated(new UserName('jan-molak'), new Timestamp(now)),
    event2 = new AccountCreated(new UserName('jan-molak'), new Timestamp(now));
    
event1.equals(event2) === true;

event1.toString() === 'AccountCreated(username=UserName(value=jan-molak), value=Timestamp(value=Mon Mar 12 2018 00:30:00 GMT+0000 (GMT)))'
```
